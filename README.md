# Advanced Python Packages talk at the DSF Summer School 2021
This repository contains the materials from the Advanced Python Packages talk given at the Data Science Festival Summer School 2021: https://events.dataidols.com/

Talk Abstract:

*Python currently is the most widely used programming language in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and AI. In-depth technical knowledge of machine learning python libraries is thus an indispensable part of the data scientist toolkit from beginner to expert level. This talk will cover three essential python packages that encompass a wide range of analytical methods. For each package, it will tackle the ‘What it does?’, the implemented methodologies, a code exercise and links to useful resources. Three additional tools will be covered as honorable mentions given their novelty and usefulness in stakeholder engagement.*


The repository contains the following files:

* `advanced_python_packages.PDF` - Slides used the talk
* `scikit_learn_tensorflow_classifier.ipynb` - Tutorial code for scikit-learn and Tensorflow
* `lung_cancer_dataset.csv` - Dataset to use in the  scikit-learn and Tensorflow tutorial code. Please note that this dataset has less patients and less genes than the dataset used in the talk. This facilitates data sharing and and allows the code to run faster.
* `pytorch_gnn_mutag.ipynb` - Tutorial code for pytorch-geometric

A video recording will be available on the Data Idols event website on 24 August.
